								<h3 class="minor">The Big and the Small</h3>
								<p>
									Imagine standing on a beach on the western spanish coast looking out over the Atlantic ocean. It stretches out as far as the eye can see, way past the horizon. Yet, the part of the ocean you can see
									is still only a small patch of the entire surface of the Earth. In fact, the part you can see is only <i>one-hundred-thousandth of a percent</i> of the entire surface of the Earth. Least to say, the Earth is ginormous.
								</p>

								<p>
									Now imagine the seeming impossible. The entire Earth, the ginormous celestial body humanity has lived on our entires lives, was shrunk to the size of the button on your shirt. About 8 millimeters. The entire mass of the Earth shrunk to this size would 
									be so dense that the electrons, protons, and neutrons composing the earth would collapse and be forced together, being crushed further and further. The shear amount of mass concentrated in such a small space would bend the trajectory of light, the fastest thing in the universe, to such a drastic
									extent that the light would become trapped, unable to espace the gravitational pull. Where the Earth once was would appear a black sphere about the size of a peanut, black because no light can bounce off of it into our eyes. The universes perfect shadow.
								</p>
								<p>
									This black sphere, the remnant of a critical gravitational collapse of the Earth, is called a <b>black hole</b>. Black holes dont have a surface like planets or stars, since any matter passing close enough to it would be irrefutably pulled in like a cosmic drain hole. They instead have
									whats called an event horizon. An event horizon is simply a region of space and time, much like the door between two rooms. Once you pass through the event horizon, like a cosmic penitentiary, you are unable to escape. In fact, not even light can escape the extreme gravity inside the event horizon.
								</p>
								<p>
									Perhaps to the dismay of the regular non-physicist, black holes are absolutely ubiquitous in the Universe. In fact, they are part of the regular stellar evolution of massive stars and represent their final step of their life. Once a massive star burns up all its full, like the fizzling out of a big firework,
									there is no energy left to resist the pull of gravity. With such a massive star, the gravity it generates begins to act against itself. With no more competition, gravity pulls the star further and further, compressing it beyond imaginable densities. Eventually, much like the shrunken Earth, it forms a black hole.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can see now why black holes are so common in our Universe. The Universe is old and there are stars everwhere! A huge amount of stars have lived and died already and many of them were big enough to form black holes at the end of their life. Astronomers even believe all galaxies we see harbor a supermassive black hole at
									their center, influencing the motion of stars in the galaxy.
