								<h3 class="minor">Our nearest neighbor</h3>
								<p>
									The best way to understand the universes unimaginable immensity is to do a little thought experiment. Imagine you're standing in downtown London holding a small sowing pin and imagine you shrunk the entire universe such that the earth was the size of the head of the sowing pin (about 2 mm). You suddenly have the urge to travel to the solar systems nearest stellar neighbor, the Alpha Centauri system.
									In this miniaturized universe, this is equivalent to walking from downtown London all the way to Chicago, Illinois. In other words, if the earth were the size of the head of a pin, the Alpha Centauri system would be 6385 km away! 
								</p>
								<p>
									But thats not the worst of it. After all, humanity has built rockets, space probes, we've even landed on other planets. The fastest man-made object, the Parker Space Probe, zipped through space at a top speed of <b>635,266 km/h</b>. How fast would this be in our miniaturized universe? A mere <b>0.02 mm/s</b>. Imagine walking from Vancouver, Canada to the border of Colombia at a speed of 0.02 mm/s. 
									It would take you over <i>7 centuries</i> to get there. Thats how long it would take to travel to the solar systems nearest stellar neighbor using the <i>fastest</i> man-made object.
								</p>

								<p>
									And this was only our nearest neighbor. Forget about the rest of the galaxy, let alone the entire universe. Rocket technology isnt going to cut it for interstellar travel. We need something much, much faster.
								</p>

								<h3 class="minor">What are our options?</h3>

								<p>
									Technically, humanity could send so-called 'generation ships' which, as the name suggests, sends a crew to a stellar system and whose decendents are the ones who arrive their. However, this comes with a number if issues, including
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>self-maintenance of the ship for several centuries</li>
									<li>enough fuel for the initial acceleration, final decceleration, and course alterations mid-journey</li>
									<li>self-sufficient human habitat for the entire journey</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									Humanity could also launch 'seed' missions, where instead of sending living humans on the mission, we send a huge amount of embryos along with their nutrients and related automatic machinery for the artifical insemination. 
									This one is even less tantilizing than the generation ships because we wont be the ones who will be traveling through space (though some might find that a positive). Additonally, there could be all sorts of issues including
									breakdown of the machinery, deterioration of the embryos, depletion of nutrients, and of course lack of personnel to maintain the ship. 
								</p>
								<p>	
									A third option would be to sending a swarm of robots to do the exploration for use and report back their findings. However, this would be the least desirable since no humans would actually be exploring the universe!
								</p>
